			<div class="what-st">
				<p>Transfer of shares means handing the rights and possibly the duties of a company member voluntarily.
					The rights and the duties of the share transfer happen from the shareholder who is wishing to not be
					a member of the company anymore to a person who is willing to be a member of the company.</p><br>
				<p>Thus the shares in a company are transferable like any other movable property in the absence of the
					expressed restrictions under the Articles of the Company.</p>

		<!-- Transfer of share by Physical mode -->
		<section class="services">
			<h2 class="title tpw" id="wi">Transfer of share by Physical mode</h2>
			<div class="tpm">
				<p>The ownership of the shares can be transferred by the delivery of the possession but there is a
					contractual relationship between the members and the company. When the transfer of the shares
					happens an instrument of transfer is required. Transferring the shares is a long procedure that
					starts with the agreement to sell and there is an execution of the deed of transfer and finally the
					registration of the transfer.</p>
				<h5>Transfer Deed</h5>
				<p>
					The transferor transferee should execute the share transfer deed as an instrument. This share
					transfer deed is to be duly signed and delivered to the Company along with the certificate that is
					relevant to the shares that are transferred. The company will not accept any instrument of the
					transfer which is not in confirmation with these provisions. In the physical mode, the transfer
					should be executed in Form SH 4.
				</p>
				<h5>Acknowledgement</h5>
				<p>At times the companies send an acknowledgment of the instrument to the transferor who has lodged a
					transfer with the company before scrutinizing the documents. This notice comes in the form of a
					letter that has a checklist for the scrutiny of the transfer documents. Some companies also issue
					transfer receipts. In case the transfer application is made by the transferor and payment for the
					shares of the company are partly made then the company should not have any objection to transferring
					the shares within 2 weeks from the receipt of the issued notice. The company is not statutorily
					obliged to give the notice to the transferor when the transfer of the documents is lodged by the
					transferee.</p>
				<h5>Scrutiny</h5>
				<p>A scrutiny should be done on the receipts of all the transfer documents to endure that all the
					documents are in place. If the transfer of the documents is not acceptable then they should be
					returned to the transferee. Also, in case if the signature of the transferor is different in the
					transfer instrument and the signature in the company's record then the documents will be returned.
				</p>
				<h5>Approval</h5>
				<p>The Board of Directors or the committee has to approve every transfer of the shares. The registration
					happens only after the approval. The right authority is required to approve it if everything is
					accepted after the scrutiny and the transfer of shares must be allowed by the board. In the case of
					the Articles of Associations of the company is empowering the board to delegate the power of
					approval of share transfer that it may also delegate it to another committee which is not including
					the directors of the company.</p>
				<h5>Registration</h5>
				<p>Any share transfers us incomplete without the registration of the share transfer. A share transfer
					form is a document through which the transferee is agreeing to accept the shares. This becomes a
					legal contract with the company. Once the company approves and also registers the transferee's name
					that is entered in the registry and it qualifies him as a member of the company. Maintenance of the
					register of the transfer is not a statutory requirement.</p>
				<h5>Delivery of Share Certificate</h5>
				<p>The transfer is effective only on the registration of such shares by the company. The company has to
					deliver the share certificate within 1 month from the receipt by the company's instrument that is
					relevant to the transfer. The instrument of the transfer should be endorsed with the respective name
					of the transferee.</p>
