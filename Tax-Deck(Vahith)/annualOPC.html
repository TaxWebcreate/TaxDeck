				<p>In countries like India where entrepreneurship is highly encouraged. One Person Company is one of the
					most leading forms of business for entrepreneurs whose business lies in an early stage with an
					intention to grow in future. A One Person Company comprises one shareholder as its member which
					indicates that it is managed and controlled by only a single person. Moreover, One Person Company is
					entitled to various privileges that other forms of business do not hold. <br>

					As to adhere with the rules and regulations, One Person Company is needed to maintain annual
					compliance according to Income Tax Act and Companies Act. The filing of yearly return and income tax
					returns is mandatory for one person company. It is simple and cost effective in terms of compliance
					to enlist as an OPC when contrasted with public or private. <br>

					As each OPC needs to indicate ROC with respect to the assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of
					the business every year, it becomes mandatory for OPC to do the compliances. In the event that the
					business neglects to do so, heavy penalties and fees are imposed for non fulfillment of annual
					compliances for OPC. In India, OPC can be enlisted uniquely as a Private Limited Company. Hence all
					the lawful arrangements which are relevant on Private Limited Company are likewise appropriate on
					OPC. Therefore, annual compliance for One person Company is obligatory. </p>

					<h3 class="sub-head">What is One Person Company Compliances?</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A One Person Company is an element getting a charge out of a
						different personality which requires keeping up its dynamic status through the standard
						recording with MCA. For each organization, it is mandatory to document a yearly return and
						examined budget summaries with MCA for each money related year. The RoC recording is obligatory
						regardless of the turnover, whether it is zero or in crore. Whether a single transaction is
						undertaken or none, annual compliances for OPC are mandatory for every registered company. Both
						the forms are filed to report the activities and financial date for concerned Financial Year.
						The due dates for yearly annual filing of a Company depend on the date of the Annual General
						Meeting. The continuous failure may lead to the removal of the companyâ€™s name from RoCâ€™s
						register, including disqualification of directors. Also, it has been observed that MCA has
						actively taken bold steps for dealing with any such failures.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3 class="sub-head">Advantages of Annual Compliances</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There are numerous benefits of a OPC company such as limited
						liability protection, easy to raise fund from venture capitalist and continuous existence while
						the confidence of the community come at the cost of increased annual compliance. It is mandatory
						for business owners to comply with Companies act, Income tax, GST & State Laws. In addition to
						the ROC compliances, Companies have to submit income tax returns every year by 30th September.
						From the year 2018, the compliance requirement has been increased now for OPC companies. There
						are various advantages of a OPC company, for example, limited liability protection, simple to
						raise support from financial speculator and ceaseless presence while the certainty of the
						network come at the expense of expanded yearly consistence. It is required for entrepreneurs to
						comply with Companies act, Income Tax Act, GST and State Laws. Notwithstanding the ROC
						compliances, Companies need to submit annual filing forms each year by 30th September. From the
						year 2018, the consistence necessity has been expanded now for OPC Companies. We guarantee to
